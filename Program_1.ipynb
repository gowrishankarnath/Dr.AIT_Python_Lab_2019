    "In cryptography, Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is also known with other names like Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift. This encryption technique is used to encrypt plain text, so only the person you want can read it. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this encryption technique, to encrypt our data,  we have to replace each letter in the text by some other letter at a fixed difference. Let's say, there is a letter ```'T'``` then with a right shift of ```1``` it will be ```'U'``` and with a left shift of ```1``` it will become ```'S'```. So here, the difference is ```1``` and the direction will also be same for a text. Either we can use left shift or right, not both in same text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand it with an easy example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have text ```\"abcdef\"``` to be encrypted. Then what we can do is replace each of letter present in the text by another letter having fixed difference. Lets say we want right shift by ```3``` then each letter of the above text have to replaced by the letter, positioned ```3 steps``` from the letter.  \n",

    "That was the basic concept of Caesar cipher.  If we see this encryption technique in mathematical way then the formula to get encrypted letter will be:\n",
